Effect of foot position during plantarflexion on the neural drive to the gastrocnemii in runners with Achilles tendinopathy

This study investigated if pointing feet-inward (feet-in) during isometric plantarflexion would increase gastrocnemius lateralis electromyography root mean square amplitude (RMS) and motor unit discharge rates, compared to feet-neutral position (feet-neutral), in runners with Achilles tendinopathy.
